# Attitude-Kinematics-Kalman-Filter
Implementation of a Kalman Filter to better estimate yaw, pitch, and roll from angular accelerations.

Utilized numerical integration (RK4 method) in combination with a Kalman Filter for better estimations of yaw, pitch, and roll rather than using pure numerical integration.
